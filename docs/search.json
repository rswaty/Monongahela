These products also include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions.\nLANDFIRE’s mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common “all-lands” data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis.\n\n “Advancing conservation outcomes through collaborative ecosystem science”"
